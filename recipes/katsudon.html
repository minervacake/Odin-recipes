Put the panko into another shallow bowl.<br><img src="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/katsudon-1.jpg" width = "250" alt ="Flour coated raw porkchops"></li>
        <li> Add thin, even layer of oil to a cast iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you throw a panko breadcrumb into the oil and it sizzles. Dip the pork into the egg to coat.<br> <img src ="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/katsudon-2.jpg" width = "250" alt="Coated porkchop dipped with egg"></li>
        <li>Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat to get a good coating</li>
        <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5-6 minutes on one side, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side for another 5-6 minutes. Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.<br> <img src="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/katsudon-3.jpg" width ="250" alt ="Porchop cooking in the pan."></li>
        <li>While the pork is resting, add the dashi stock (or chicken stock), sugar, soy sauce, and mirin to a small bowl. In another bowl, lightly beat 2 eggs. Add a tablespoon of oil to a pan over medium heat, and add the sliced onion. Fry the onions until theyâ€™re translucent and slightly caramelized.<br> <img src ="https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/katsudon-4.jpg" width ="250" alt ="Stir fry onions"></li>
